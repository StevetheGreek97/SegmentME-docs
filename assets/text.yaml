intro: >
  SegmentME is a powerful image annotation and segmentation tool designed for high-throughput phenotyping, object instance analysis, and smart annotation workflows using models like SAM2, DEXTR, and YOLO. The application provides a user-friendly interface to annotate, manage, and visualize image data with rich statistics and custom tooling. It supports various image formats and integrates seamlessly with machine learning models for efficient annotation tasks. SegmentME is ideal for researchers, data scientists, and anyone needing to annotate images quickly and accurately.

tools:
  SAM2:
    desc: >
      Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a state-of-the-art foundation model for segmentation.
      You can interactively segment objects by clicking foreground (positive) or background (negative) points.
      Ideal for general object boundaries.

      **Press `E`** to execute the model. **Press `S`** to save the mask.

  SAM2-Box:
    desc: >
      Use SAM2 by drawing a bounding box. This is useful when you want to quickly guide the model
      to a specific region of interest.

      **Press `E`** to generate the mask. **Press `S`** to save it.

  DEXTR:
    desc: >
      Deep Extreme Cut (DEXTR) segments objects using 4+ extreme points (top, bottom, left, right).
      It's particularly good for segmenting distinct, irregular shapes with minimal clicks.

      **Press `E`** to generate the mask. **Press `S`** to save it.

  Manual:
    desc: >
      This tool allows freehand polygon annotation by clicking around the object's edges.
      Perfect for full manual control when automatic tools arenâ€™t accurate.

      **Press `S`** to finalize and save the mask.

  Scissors:
    desc: >
      The intelligent scissors tool follows image edges between seed points, making it great for tracing complex contours.
      It offers semi-automatic support by snapping paths to high-contrast boundaries.

      **Press `S`** to save the completed mask.

  Inference:
    desc: >
        The Inference tool allows you to automatically annotate your entire uploaded dataset using a pretrained model 
        (e.g., YOLO, SAM, etc). This is ideal for bulk annotation or initializing masks before refinement.

        Choose the model and the confidence threshold for the inference.
        **Press `Run`** to start the inference process. The model will process all images in the project folder and generate masks based on the selected model.
        Annotated masks will be automatically saved.

create_project:
  instructions: |


    1. Click **Create New Project** in the main menu  
    2. Enter a project name (e.g., `MyCoolProject`)  
    3. Choose or create a target folder to save your project

  setup: |

    - The project folder will contain all images, masks, and metadata.
    - A `project_name.SEproj` will be created in the target folder, which is used to manage the project. The project will be automatically loaded into the application.
    - You can create multiple projects to organize your work.
    - Each project is independent and can have its own classes and annotations.

image_import:
  instructions: |
    - Once you create the project, the application will prompt you to import images.
    - You can also import images later by Clicking the **File â†’ Import Images** Duplicate images will be skipped. 

    - Supported formats:`.jpg` `.png` `.jpeg` `.tiff`


add_class:
  instructions: |

    - Use the **Class Selector** panel (left sidebar)
    1. Click `Add Class`
    2. Enter a class name (e.g., `d_galeata`, `d_pulex`)
    3. Chooce a color for the class
    4. New class appears in the dropdown and color map

remove_class:
  instructions: |
    - Use the **Class Selector** panel (left sidebar)
    1. Select the class in the dropdown
    2. Click `Remove Selceted`
    3. All masks with this class will be deleted (confirmation required)


delete_masks:
  instructions: |
    - Use the **Annotation Selector** panel (right sidebar) or click the mask in the image
    1. Select the anntatation in the table
    2. Click `del` key
    3. The selected mask will be deleted 
    
    ðŸ§  Tip: You can delete multiple masks at once using checkboxes in the table.

rename_masks:
  instructions: |
    - Use the **Annotation Selector** panel (right sidebar) or click the mask in the image
    1. Select the anntatation in the table
    2. Duble-click the `Class` row of the selected mask
    3. Enter a new name for the mask
    4. The mask will be renamed in the table 
    5. if that class does not exist, the annotation will be assigned to the `Unclassified` class (white color). *Important: this will not create a new class, it will just rename the mask*. You should manually create a new class if needed.
export_annotations:
  instructions: |

      SegmentME allows you to export all annotation data from your project for training, analysis, or sharing.

      **Exported Files:**
      - `.txt` files for each image, saved in the `annotations/curent_date` folder
      - Each line represents a polygon mask in the format:  
        `class_id x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn`
      - `data.yaml` file containing:
        - List of class names
